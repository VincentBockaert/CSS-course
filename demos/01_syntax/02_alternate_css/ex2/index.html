	<h1>Notes on a stylesheet selection UI in Mozilla</h1>

	<p>

		A good system for selection of alternate and user stylesheets has
		not yet appeared in a web browser.  The only browser that supports
		any part of such a system is Opera, and the features are very limited.
		Here I present a few ideas on what I think such a system would be.

	</p>

	<p>

		Todd Fahrner has some <a href="http://style.verso.com/cssui/">notes
		on many other issues</a> relating to the UI of a CSS-based browser.

	</p>

	<h2>Why?</h2>

	<p>

		Alternate and user stylesheets give control to the user and
		make web browsing a much more pleasant experience.  A good
		interface would allow users to easily switch between user
		stylesheets and between author stylesheets, and to easily
		disable either.  They also encourage web page authors to
		maintain accessibility.
	</p>

	<p>
		Alternate stylesheets allow authors
		to present a web page in different ways using the same content.
		This can be used to present the same page in different layouts
		or for different audiences.  The different sheets could be targeted
		towards different types of audiences (within a company, outside it)
		or just to people with different preferences.
	</p>

	<p>
		User stylesheets are an important accessibility feature.  They are
		already supported in a very simplistic way by MSIE (since version
		4, or maybe earlier) and by Opera.  However, the simple interfaces
		they provide make user stylesheets almost unusable because the state
		of the web today requires turning off user stylesheets for many
		poorly designed pages.  Thus a more comprehensive interface is needed.
		Furthermore, a user may want to switch easily between his own stylesheets
		for reasons of taste or usability.
	</p>

	<!--
	<p>
		Microsoft has bet their future (i.e, Office 2000) on badly
		written CSS all in style elements.  User stylesheets will show
		users how bad this output really is.
	</p>
	-->

	<h2>What features</h2>

	<h3>Alternate stylesheet selection</h3>

	<p>
		A good alternate stylesheet user interface will allow users to
		switch between alternate stylesheets provided by the author.
		It will also allow the user to <em>choose that none of the
		preferred or alternate stylesheets is applied</em> (however,
		persistent stylesheets would still be applied - see later in
		this section).  This latter choice is what I call "No Optional
		Styles" in the menus below.  These features are already
		implemented internally in Mozilla; they only need to be exposed
		in the UI.  Peter Linss wrote in an email message to me (quoted
		with permission):
	</p>

	<!-- permission to quote given in email of Tue, 18 May 1999 14:50:11 -0700 -->

	<pre>I added some utility methods to nsIPresShell a while back to make
	connecting this UI simple (this is what the extra cheesy viewer code
	uses):
	  NS_IMETHOD GetActiveAlternateStyleSheet(nsString&amp; aSheetTitle) = 0;
	  NS_IMETHOD SelectAlternateStyleSheet(const nsString&amp; aSheetTitle) = 0;
	  NS_IMETHOD ListAlternateStyleSheets(nsStringArray&amp; aTitleList) = 0;

	To access the title of the default sheet you use the Get/SetHeaderData api
	on nsIDocument under the "Default-Style" header field. This is initialized
	to the preferred sheet title, selecting a different alternate doesn't
	effect it. You can also pass "" as the title to turn off all but persistent
	sheets.
	</pre>

	<p>
		Ian Hickson has written <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/%7Epy8ieh/internet/discussion/linkelement.txt">some
		notes</a> that may be useful in using these functions.  They may be
		especially relevant for internationalization issues.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code>No optional styles</code> means that no author
		<dfn>preferred</dfn> or <dfn>alternate</dfn> stylesheets will be
		used, but <dfn>persistent</dfn> stylesheets will (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML 4.0</a> for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#h-14.3.1">
		explanation of these terms</a>).  It should thus be one of the mutually
		exclusive choices for preferred/alternate styles, which is what the
		choices in the first part of <code>Page Styles</code> are.
	</p>


	<h3>Disabling author CSS</h3>

	<p>
		If a page becomes unusable because of bad styles (possibly bad style
		that works in buggy browsers), the user should be able to turn off
		all author styles (including persistent linked stylesheets, style elements,
		and style attributes).  This should be an option on the same menu as those
		listed above.  See my examples below for how I would distinguish it from
		the above choices.  I don't think this is implemented yet, but it could be
		very useful.  (Note that user styles and UA styles would still apply.)
	</p>

	<p>
		In contrast to <code>No optional styles</code>,
		the <code>disable author styles</code> menuitem used below
		will disable all author
		stylesheets (including STYLE elements and STYLE attributes).
	</p>

	<h3>Author stylesheet selection permanence (and memory)</h3>

	<p>

		Should there be some sort of a style memory that remembers the
		combination of remember until and the selection, and stores, say, the
		previous 200 (configurable) pages visited, and goes by the most
		recent thing that applies to a given page?  If there is a memory, then
		"Remember until" and "Disable until" should become (as they did in
		<em>some</em> of the examples below) "Remember for" and "Disable for."

	</p>

	<p>
		The different permanence options that I use below are the following:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Selected Style</dt>
		<dd>Remember this choice of stylesheet (while / when) this is one of
		the choices the author gives.</dd>

		<dt>This List of Styles (default)</dt>
		<dd>Remember this choice of stylesheet (while / when) this list of
		stylesheets is the one the author gives.</dd>

		<dt>This Page</dt>
		<dd>Remember this choice of stylesheet (while / when) user is looking
		at this page.</dd>
	</dl>


	<h3>User stylesheet selection and disabling</h3>

	<p>
		User stylesheets are an exciting feature of CSS.  They allow the user
		to specify the default rendering of a document either at a level
		between the UA's defaults and the author, or at a level that overrides
		the author.  They are almost a necessity for users with some
		disabilities who are prevented from using the web.  They are also a
		neat feature for general (well, maybe geeky, but they're the types
		who design web pages) users.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, many pages around today are designed badly, and thus
		interact badly with user stylesheets.  Therefore, a good UI for user
		stylesheets would allow the user to disable the user stylesheet when
		it conflicts with pages (using the same memory options I give above
		for selection of author stylesheets).  It would also allow the user
		to switch between a group of user-configurable stylesheets so he
		could view the page in a different style depending on his mood.
	</p>

	<h2>The example</h2>

	<p>

		As an example, I will use <a href="http://dbaron.org/css/">my homepage</a>.  It has <a href="http://dbaron.org/css/style/index">one persistent stylesheet</a>, one preferred
		stylesheet, <a href="http://dbaron.org/css/style/forest">Forest</a>, and four alternate
		stylesheets, <a href="http://dbaron.org/css/style/plain">Plain</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/Ultramarine">Ultramarine</a>,
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/Steely">Steely</a>, and
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/Oldstyle">Oldstyle</a>.

	</p>

	<p>

		Furthermore, for user stylesheets, I will assume that the eight <a href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/preview">W3C Core Styles</a>
		are set up as user stylesheets.  (They would need to be modified a
		bit, but that's besides the point for now.)

	</p>

	<h3 id="submenu">As part of View menu</h3>

	<p>
		Probably the most logical place for such an interface is on the
		View menu.  Images of these menus as top-level menus are available
		<a href="#toplevel">below</a>.
	</p>

	<ul class="menu">
		<li>
			<span class="menulabel">V</span>iew
			<ul>
				<li>
					Increase Font Size
				</li>
				<li>
					Decrease Font Size
				</li>
				<li>
					Magnify
				</li>
				<li>
					Un-magnify
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="menulabel">A</span>uthor's Style
					<ul>
						<li class="radio"><span class="menulabel">F</span>orest (default)</li>
						<li><span class="menulabel">P</span>lain</li>

						<li><span class="menulabel">N</span>o Optional Styles</li>
						<li><span class="menulabel">D</span>isable Author's Styles</li>
						<li>———</li>
						<li><span class="menulabel">R</span>emember for
							<ul>
								<li>Selected <span class="menulabel">S</span>tyle</li>
								<li class="radio">This <span class="menulabel">L</span>ist of Styles</li>
								<li>This <span class="menulabel">P</span>age</li>
								<li>———</li>
								<li class="check"><span class="menulabel">A</span>lways Disable</li>
								<li>———</li>
								<li><span class="menulabel">M</span>emory ...</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="menulabel">M</span>y Style
					<ul>
						<li><u>N</u>one</li>
						<li><u>O</u>ldstyle</li>
						<li><u>M</u>odernist</li>
						<li><u>M</u>idnight</li>
						<li><u>U</u>ltramarine</li>
						<li><u>S</u>wiss</li>
						<li><u>C</u>hocolate</li>
						<li><u>T</u>raditional</li>
						<li><u>S</u>teely</li>
						<li></li>
						<li><u>D</u>isable Until
							<ul>
								<li>?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><u>C</u>onfigure...</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If "Always Disable" is checked, "Disable Page Styles"
		should probably be grayed and checked.
	</p>

	<p>
		Should the author styles menu disappear if there are no stylesheets (linked, STYLE
		elements, or STYLE attributes)?  I'm not sure...
